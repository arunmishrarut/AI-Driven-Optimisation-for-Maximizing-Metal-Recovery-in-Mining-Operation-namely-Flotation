📊 **Scale of the problem**
<br>
* The mining industry produces roughly **12.7 billion metric tons of tailings per year across all minerals**. 
* Specifically for **iron ore, around 1.4 billion tons** of tailings are generated annually 
* With average iron content in tailings at ≈11%, that means about **154 million tons of iron go unrecovered each year**
* **Source: en.wikipedia.org**

**💰 Lost economic value**

* Iron ore prices vary, but a reasonable mid-2025 average is around $100 per ton.
* 154 million tons × $100 ≈ **$15.4 billion lost annually just in iron content**.
*This **doesn't include other valuable metals** (copper, nickel, cobalt, etc.) **or downstream losses** from lower concentrate quality.
*In **North America alone**, the metals **lost** in tailings are valued at **around $20 billion per year**.

**✏️ Implications for the project**
<br>

**If automating** amine and starch **dosing can recover even a fraction of that lost iron—say 5 %** of the 154 million tons (~7.7 Mt)—it could **translate to $770 million in recovered value annually** (at $100/t).
